# CS--Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech
**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
>The two projects that I have uploaded is the first and last thing we did in this course. The first thing we did was make the LEDs fade in and out. The last thing we did was make a mock thermostat. That would allow the user to change the set temperature for the thermostat by pushing one of the side buttons.

**What did you do particularly well?**
>I think that one of the things that I did particularly well was learning how to manipulate our embedded systems broad while also learning how to use Code Composer Studio.
 
**Where could you improve?**
>One of the areas that I could improve is by taking more time to prepare/design what I am going to do, before I start changing the code.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**
>The tools / resources that I am adding to my support network is the knowledge of Embedded C Programming and how it is starting to impact and grow more in the world everyday.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**
>The skill that I think will transfer well is the knowledge of state machines and how to set them up and use them.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
> I tried to keep this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using best coding practices that I have learned from past coruses.
